# ✨ My Webpage Portfolio Project ✨

Hey there! 👋 This repository is part of my professional and creative portfolio. I’m building it **from scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch** → no templates, no frameworks, no copy-paste. 
Why? Because I want to **practice my programming** and **show what I’m capable of creating** with my own hands and artistic vision. 
This is a living, evolving space where I explore, build, and share my creative and technical work. 
It's a blend of design 🎨, storytelling 📖, and programming 💻.

## 🚧💻 Work in Progress
This site is **under active development** → some parts may be in draft mode, experimental, or mid-redesign. 
That’s intentional! It reflects my process, growth, and curiosity. 🌱

## 🎯 Purpose & Vision

Because I love blending the technical with the artistic, this project is my lab, my canvas, and my calling card. 
Here I practice, test ideas, and prepare to show the world what I can do.

This project is my new **canvas** for practicing **programming** and showcasing my creativity:

- Technical skills 🧩
- Visual storytelling and branding 🎥
- Interactive design and user experience 🎯
- Iterative thinking and creative problem-solving 🔄
- Visual design that reflects my personal style 🎨✨
- A space to experiment, learn, and grow as a creative developer 🧪📚🌱

## 💡 Why This Matters

I believe in **transparent creativity** → showing not just polished results, but the journey behind them. 
This repo is a window into how I think, build, and evolve as a creative storyteller and designer. 🧠✨

## 🌐 Current Portfolio

My current portfolio is hosted on Wix: [www.deredhuzent.com](http://www.deredhuzent.com)  
Once this project is complete, I plan to **migrate everything here** to make it fully custom, self-coded, and reflective of my creative evolution.
